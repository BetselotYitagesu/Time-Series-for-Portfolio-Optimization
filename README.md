Task 1 â€” Preprocess and Explore Financial Data
Overview

This task covers the initial data acquisition, cleaning, and exploratory analysis stages for the Time Series Forecasting for Portfolio Management Optimization project. The goal is to fetch historical financial data for key assets, preprocess the data to ensure quality, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract insights for later modeling.
Objectives

    Download historical stock and ETF data for:

        Tesla (TSLA)

        Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)

        S&P 500 ETF (SPY)

    Clean and preprocess the data:

        Handle missing values and ensure consistent business-day indexing

        Calculate returns, log returns, and rolling volatility

    Conduct exploratory data analysis:

        Visualize price trends and volatility

        Detect outliers and analyze extreme return days

        Test stationarity of price and returns series (Augmented Dickey-Fuller test)

        Calculate key risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Sharpe Ratio
